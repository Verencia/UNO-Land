Simple Android implementation of the UNO Card game

Players: user | computer

At the start of the game, each player gets 7 cards from the deck. The next card from the deck becomes the first card on the pile. When it is a player's turn, they put one card from their hand onto the pile. The card must either be the same color or number as the card currently on the top of the pile. If the player can't place any card, they need to pick up a card from the deck.
The first player to have zero cards left is the winner.
